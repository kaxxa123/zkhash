# zkhash Demo


## Requirements

1. To run this demo [install ZoKrates](https://zokrates.github.io/gettingstarted.html).
    

1. To run the on-chain verification, [truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) is required.
  Here is the truffle version information used to test this demo:

    ```
    $ truffle version

    Truffle v5.4.17 (core: 5.4.17)
    Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
    Node v12.22.1
    Web3.js v1.5.3
    ```

## Demo Installation

This demo is based on the SHA256 preimage example available [here](https://zokrates.github.io/examples/sha256example.html).


However, the code was slightly modified to make it a bit easier to explain.
Check the original code under [original.zok](./original.zok).


The code we will be working with is under [sha256.zok](./sha256.zok).

To quickly test the demo, run:
```BASH
git clone https://github.com/kaxxa123/zkhash.git
cd zkhash
./4_all.sh
```
If everything goes well, you will finally see the verification 
result from truffle:

  ```

## Demo Details

* To run this demo, we make use of the following online tools:

    [SHA256 Online Generator](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)

    [Decimal to Hex Convertor](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html)


* This ZKP is about proving SHA256 preimage knowledge. In this case our preimage is a 256-bit integer having value 5. 
  More specifically the hash preimage in hex is:

  ```
  00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005
  ```

* The SHA256 for this hex input is:
  ```
  c6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10
  ```

* Next, we need to break this 256-bit output into 2 x 128-bit values
  and covert them to decimal:

  ```
  c6481e22c5ff4164af680b8cfaa5e8ed  -> 263561599766550617289250058199814760685
  3120eeff89c4f307c4a6faaae059ce10  -> 65303172752238645975888084098459749904
  ```

* In this manner we generate the ZKP proof inputs as shown in
  [2_prover.sh](./2_prover.sh) in the command:

  ```BASH
  zokrates compute-witness -a 0 0 0 5 263561599766550617289250058199814760685 65303172752238645975888084098459749904
  ```
